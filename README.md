# Number-Guessing-Game

This number guessing game was coded using HTML, CSS, and JS. Coding this game helped me grow my understanding of JS arrays.

3/5/2022: While my code correctly determines whether the player's guess or the computer's guess was closer to the randomly generated number, I will need to prevent the player from entering either text or a number outside the specified range (i.e. 0-10). 

3/6/2022-3/7/2022: I have successfully implemented code that prevents the player from entering either text or a number outside the specified range (i.e. 0-10). The game now ends once one of the players (either the human or the computer) reach 10 points.
